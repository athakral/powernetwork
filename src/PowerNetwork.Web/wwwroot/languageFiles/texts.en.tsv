Main.Box1.Header			Loading<br />monitoring
Main.Box1.Content			The power outlet measurement allows to identify meters overloading and unbalances among grids by sending alarms to the system, reducing on the ground visits
Main.Box2.Header			Fraud<br/>detection
Main.Box2.Content			The fraud detection identifies handled smart meters and out of normal power consumptions to tackle the problem
Main.Box3.Header			Probability<br/>of failure
Main.Box3.Content			The probability to failure allows to identify which assets are at risk to define critical and extraordinary maintenance
Main.Box4.Header			Maintenance<br/>management
Main.Box4.Content			The Maintenance Management allows to determine the Transformation Centers on which to carry out preventive maintenance in function of its probability of failure and its technical and economic criticality
Main.Box5.Header			Capex<br/>allocation
Main.Box5.Content			The CapEx optimization of network deployment allows to increase the coverage and quality of customers with higher value for the company, resulting in increased revenue and reduced churn.
